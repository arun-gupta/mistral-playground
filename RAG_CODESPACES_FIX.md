# RAG Codespaces Fix

## Problem
The RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) functionality was failing in Codespaces with the following error:

```
AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'get_or_create_collection'
```

This occurred because ChromaDB was failing to initialize properly in the Codespaces environment, likely due to SQLite version conflicts or other environment-specific issues.

## Root Cause
The RAG service was designed to use ChromaDB as the primary vector database, but when ChromaDB failed to initialize, the service would set `self.chroma_client = None` and then raise a `RuntimeError` when trying to use it. However, the code was still attempting to call methods on the `None` client before the error check.

## Solution
Implemented a comprehensive FAISS fallback system that:

1. **Automatic Fallback**: When ChromaDB is not available, the service automatically falls back to FAISS for vector storage
2. **Complete Feature Parity**: All RAG functionality (upload, query, list, delete, stats) works with FAISS fallback
3. **Persistent Storage**: FAISS collections are saved to disk using pickle format
4. **Metadata Support**: Collection metadata is properly stored and retrieved

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced RAGService Initialization
- Added `faiss_collection_metadata` attribute to store collection metadata
- Improved FAISS collection loading/saving with metadata support
- Better error handling during initialization

### 2. Updated Core Methods
- `process_document()`: Now uses `_process_document_faiss()` when ChromaDB is unavailable
- `query_rag()`: Now uses `_query_rag_faiss()` when ChromaDB is unavailable
- `list_collections()`: Now uses `_list_collections_faiss()` when ChromaDB is unavailable
- `delete_collection()`: Now uses `_delete_collection_faiss()` when ChromaDB is unavailable
- `get_collection_stats()`: Now uses `_get_collection_stats_faiss()` when ChromaDB is unavailable

### 3. New FAISS-Specific Methods
- `_process_document_faiss()`: Handles document processing with FAISS
- `_query_rag_faiss()`: Handles RAG queries with FAISS
- `_list_collections_faiss()`: Lists collections stored in FAISS
- `_delete_collection_faiss()`: Deletes collections from FAISS
- `_get_collection_stats_faiss()`: Gets statistics for FAISS collections

### 4. Improved Data Persistence
- FAISS collections and metadata are saved together in a structured format
- Backward compatibility with existing FAISS collections
- Proper error handling for file operations

## Testing
Created test scripts to verify the fix:
- `test_rag_fix.py`: Tests basic RAG service initialization
- `test_rag_upload.py`: Tests document upload functionality

## Dependencies
The fix relies on the existing `faiss-cpu==1.7.4` dependency in `requirements-codespaces-rag.txt`, which is already included for Codespaces environments.

## Usage
No changes required in the frontend or API endpoints. The fix is transparent to users - the RAG functionality will automatically use FAISS when ChromaDB is not available.

## Benefits
1. **Reliability**: RAG functionality now works reliably in Codespaces
2. **Performance**: FAISS provides fast vector similarity search
3. **Compatibility**: Works with existing ChromaDB installations
4. **Transparency**: No user-facing changes required
5. **Persistence**: Collections are properly saved and restored

## Future Improvements
- Add support for more vector database backends (Pinecone, Weaviate, etc.)
- Implement collection migration between backends
- Add performance monitoring and metrics
- Enhance metadata storage and querying capabilities
